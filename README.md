# cluster_monte_carlo
programs which analyze the Ising model in an arbitrary number of dimensions >= 2 using two types of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.

## implementation of metropolis-hastings and Wolff algorithms for any dimensions
see comparisons which highlight superior solution of autocorrelation time problem found in the MEtropolis 
Hastings algorithms solved by Cluster algorithms

# exploration of critical dynamics with cluster algorithms
temperature scans to evaluate critical exponents
Compare with known literature values

## Validation of the Cluster Algorithm
